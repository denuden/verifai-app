/**
 *  Since all the dispatchers are of the same type (CoroutineDispatcher),
 *  simply providing them without qualifiers would confuse Hilt—it wouldn’t know which one to inject where.
 *  By creating custom qualifiers (like @IoDispatcher or @MainDispatcher), you’re giving Hilt a way to distinguish between them,
 *  so it knows exactly which dispatcher to inject in each case.
